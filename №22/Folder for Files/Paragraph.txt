     Quantum entanglement is a label for the observed physical phenomenon
that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated, interact, or
share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each 
particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the 
state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large 
distance.
